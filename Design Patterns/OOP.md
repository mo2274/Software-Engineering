	Object Orinted Programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of wrapping pieces of data and behaviors related to this data together into bundles called objects, and these objects constructed from blueprints called classes.

**Pillars of OOP:**
	**1. Abstraction:**
		- Is a model of a real world object but in a specific context, which represent all details relevant to this context with high accuracy and omit the rest.
	**2. Encapsulation:**
		- It is the ability of an object to hide parts of its state and behaviours from other objects and exposing only a limited interface to the rest of the program.
	**3. Inheritance:**
		- It is the ability of an object to take state and behaviours from other objects. and this could be beneficial if the two objects are in the same context and the two objects define a (IS A) relationship and it is used to achieve polymorphism. but if we misused it, it can introduce tight coupling between classes.
    **4. Polymorphism:**
		 - It is the ability of an object to take different shapes.
		 we can achieve dynamic polymorphism by inheritance and static polymorphism by method overloading.

**Composition:**
	 - It is a mechanism of creating a class by combining one or more other classes to be its parts , attributes or components. the components can only exists as a part of the main object.
**Association:**
	-  It is a type of relationship which one object uses or interacts with another object.
     	`Order -------> Customer`
**Aggregations:**
	- Is a type of composition but the components can exist without the main object and can be linked to different objects.
